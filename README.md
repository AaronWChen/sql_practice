# SQL Practice

This repository contains two `.sh` files that will allow you to create both
a SQLite and PostgreSQL database from files from the [City of Chicago's open data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).

```bash
# install necessary packages
sh install_packages.sh

# download chicago data sets
sh create_chicago_database.sh
```
